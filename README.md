This repository contains all the information and code produced for the Prinses Maxima Center / Google hackathon.

## Idea

Considering using LLM to compose children's stories that help them grasp the procedures and side effects they might undergo during oncology treatment. We could also leverage Imagen to produce a picture book or speech to text. For a more personalized touch, we could even incorporate a cartoon character, perhaps the child's favorite, into the story.
